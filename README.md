# PARE: Parallel and Resource-Efficient Scheduling Framework

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks that implement and extend the **PARE (Parallel and Resource-Efficient) scheduling framework** with experiments and visualizations.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### 1. `PARE_scheduling.ipynb`
- Core implementation of the **PARE scheduling algorithm**.  
- Focuses on the basic scheduling pipeline, including resource allocation and task distribution.  
- Demonstrates how the framework can optimize **parallel execution** for given workloads.

### 2. `PARE_with_graphs.ipynb`
- Builds upon the core PARE scheduling implementation.  
- Includes **visualizations and graphs** to analyze the performance of the scheduling algorithm.  
- Provides plots for:
  - Task completion times  
  - Resource utilization  
  - Throughput and efficiency metrics  

### 3. `PARE1.ipynb`
- A variant of the PARE implementation, exploring alternative configurations and improvements.  
- Useful for benchmarking and comparing different approaches under the same framework.
